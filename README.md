# ztreeDeptSelect
a dept select plugin based in jquery and ztree

to run the source code ,you should get a VS2010(or later),or IIS support .net framework4.0(or later) to deploy the website.
find the index.html in 'demo' folder,browser with IE or Firefox.

to use this plugin. please refer to index.html in 'demo' folder.

Be careful,the 'src' folder,has two files named: deptDialog.html and DeptDialogDataHandler.ashx
which is just for demo use.
In real application,you should modify the two files,or use other programing language.
in order to get your business department data.

Thank youÔºÅ
